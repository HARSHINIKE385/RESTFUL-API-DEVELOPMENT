DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK:

  This project demonstrates a simple Library API built using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, and is designed to showcase basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a clear, interactive way. The API uses an in-memory list books as a temporary database to store book entries, making it ideal for quick testing and demonstration purposes. It is implemented entirely in Google Colab, which allows users to run Python code in a cloud-based environment without any local setup. This makes the project highly accessible, even for those who may not have Flask or Python installed on their local machine.

The API provides three core endpoints. First, the POST /books endpoint allows users to add new books to the library. Each book is represented as a JSON object containing title and author fields. When a book is added, the server responds with a confirmation message and the book details, demonstrating the Create operation in CRUD. This makes it easy to see how new data can be dynamically added to a web service.

Second, the GET /books endpoint returns all stored books in JSON format. This endpoint is used to demonstrate the Read operation, allowing users to retrieve and visualize the current state of the library. By testing this endpoint after adding books, users can verify that their data is correctly stored and returned.

Third, the project includes a POST /_reset endpoint that clears the in-memory database. This simulates the Delete operation, ensuring that users can reset the library to an empty state. This is particularly useful during demonstrations or iterative testing when repeated operations are needed.

The project also includes optional code for adding multiple books at once, which showcases the flexibility of the API in handling batch data operations. This demonstrates how a simple web service can scale to store and retrieve multiple records efficiently.

All operations are run interactively in Google Colab, leveraging its built-in Python environment and the ability to open a live Flask server in an iframe. This allows users to interact with the API directly from the notebook, making it ideal for teaching, demos, or rapid prototyping.

Potential use cases for this project include educational tutorials on REST APIs, prototyping web applications that require simple data storage, or internal tools for managing small datasets like books, inventory, or user records. While the current implementation uses an in-memory list, it can be easily extended to use a persistent database such as SQLite or PostgreSQL for real-world applications.

Overall, this Library API project is a straightforward, beginner-friendly demonstration of CRUD functionality, highlighting the power of Flask and Google Colab for web development experiments, learning, and rapid prototyping.
